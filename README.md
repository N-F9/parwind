# Parwind

Parwind is a general-purpose website template that utilizes various technologies to accelerate development. [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling, development, and builds; [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for design; [Pug.js](https://pugjs.org/) for HTML rendering; [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for better styling; [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for better type-support.

You can host with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or any other host.

For the best possible developing experience when using VSCode, I recommend installing some Intellisense plugins like [Path](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) and [Tailwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss); other than that, you should be good to go.
